Convert linear scanned monochrome film without automatic corrections,
making it possible to understand your exposure and development characteristics.

## Using it
File an issue if you're interested in using this and have a hard time figuring out how.
It's very specific to my workflow.

I made this because I've always felt the need for less magic and more control compared to other tools available.

## Compile things

```
# Reload hs/elm/css on save
./build-dev.sh

# Build hs/elm, embed js/html/css into hs output binary
./build-bin.sh
```
